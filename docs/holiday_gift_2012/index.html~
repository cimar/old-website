		<h2>The Christmas Demo EP! <small>FOR MOM, DAD & ANTHONY</small></h2>
		<p>For the family who has been so supportive of my creative endeavors over the years, but only gets to see a sliver of them because I'm a perfectionist.  I've tried to throw a little bit of that out the window in putting this album together, so expect the mic to peak, and the guitar to fumble: <b>(a)</b> because I wouldn't have gotten it done otherwise <b>(b)</b> with the exception of the first track for which I don't really know what the point is, the point is mostly the songwriting, not the production/performance <b>(c)</b> you're my parents/brother and you love me. - r</p>

		<h4>TRACKLISTING<small> click titles for lyrics</small></H4>
		<p>1. <b><a href="#Blue_River">Blue River</a></b> (Mitchell/Hayes/Johnson) <b>1:57</b> <i>Specially written/adapted for this EP, consider it the digital musical equivalent of a macaroni photo frame.</i></p>
		<p>2. <b><a href="#Sweet_Something">Sweet Something</b></a> (Cima) <b>2:59</b> <i>Chords inspired by a Rolling Stones song in a somber montage a James Bond movie in a dream, probably the first thing I will play on Sal's telecaster.</i></p>
		<p>3. <b><a href="#Runaway_Heart">Runaway Heart</a></b> (Cima) <b>3:07</b> <i>A Hank-Williams-y kind of thing, with mixed metaphors and mixed guitar-playing.  The production quality is more forgivable if you pretend I am indigenous to somewhere and have hookworm.</i></p>
		<p>4. <b><a href="#Setting_Sun">House of My Setting Sun</a></b> (Cima) <b>2:33</b> <i>I spent a while recording it on multiple tracks only to find that I liked the extra-early version I played into my iPhone way better than anyting else, why it's in mp4.</i></p>

		<h3>Blue River</h3>
		<p>It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees<br/>
		They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace<br/>
		I wish I had a river I could skate away on<br/>
		Oh oh oh oh I made my baby cry<br/>
		I wish I had a river</p>
		<p>When those white snow flakes start falling<br/>
		I'll hear my blue, blue memory a-calling<br/>
		You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white<br/>
		But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas</p>

		<h3>Sweet Something</h3>
		<p>Sweet Peggy Sue<br/>
		She never wanted nobody<br/>
		To feel blue<br/>
		Or write a song<p/>

		<p>What do you do<br/>
		When you're not after his money<br/>
		Oh and the choir won't quit humming 'girl get along'?</p>

		<p><b>Country singer doesn't know how to let go<br/>
		Of the river that floods his words<br/>
		Take one hard good look at me and you'll know<br/>
		That I never have trouble being heard</b></p>

		<p>Sweet Mary Jane</br>
		She left that boy down on the corner</br>
		Clutching his crutches</br>
		With shaking hands</p>

		<p>Who do you blame</br>
		For all the highs the lows the rushes</br>
		All of the good times wasting good time that you can stand?</p>

		<p><b>Some people never learn how to let go</br>
		Of the threads they're hanging on</br>
		Take one hard good look at me and you'll know</br>
		That I've never I've never I've never I've never been wrong</b></p>

		<p>Sweet Lady Life</br>
		Oh we've been dancing for a long time </br>
		On the edge of this knife</br>
		In the back of a girl</p>

		<p>I wonder why</br>
		For all our twisting and our jiving</br>
		She's still standing she's still smiling her hair's still curled</br>

		<p><b>Some people really know how to let go</br>
		Of the chains that hold them down</br>
		Take one hard good look at me and you'll know</br>
		That this face it ain't never known a frown</b></p>

		<h3>Runaway Heart</h3>
		<p><b>CHORUS<br/>
		Got a runaway heart<br/>
		Got a runaway heart<br/>
		Runaway-ay-ay</p></b>
	
		<p>Never known a love lost<br/>
		Faster than I lost yours<br/>
		My heart left my body that's the cost<br/>
		Wearing a lifetime of lovin' reward</p>

		<p><b>CHORUS</b></p>

		<p>I started chasing it chasing you<br/>
		Catching all the blood I could save<br/>
		I swear someday we'll meet until then it won't rest a beat<br/>
		It's sustained by the song of a slave</p>

		<p>And if you keep picking it'll never heel/heal<br/>
		Oh if you kep picking it'll never heel/heal<br/>
		If you keep picking it'll never heel/heal<br/>
		If you keep picking it'll never heel/heal</p>

		<p><b>CHORUS</b></p>

		<h3>House of My Setting Sun</h3>

		<p>There's a house down in Los Angeles<br/>
		I call my setting sun<br/>
		Oblivion waits there for me<br/>
		At the hands of a lovely one</p>

		<p>She's got fingers like piano keys<br/>
		And hair as fair as August<br/>
		A hot white bullet she's promised me<br/>
		And her word I trust</p>

		<p>Her lover was a movies man<br/>
		Eyes like a silver screen<br/>
		He swore he'd see her through the end<br/>
		But then those eyes caught me</p>

		<p>He let me play the role<br/>
		Of a Juliet in flight<br/>
		He peered into my soul<br/>
		And then turned out the light</p>

		<p>And now we live in Burlingame<br/>
		Two bedroom tan and beige<br/>
		And every day here is the same<br/>
		His silver's all gone grey</p>

		<p>There's an old house in Los Angeles<br/>
		I call my Brigadoon<br/>
		A crimson climax cries for me<br/>
		I might just answer soon</p>

		<br/><br/><br/>
